This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).




## Basic Voting-System application built with React 

## Features
- This is a simple vote calculator example which increments count on every click. I introduce the Stateful Component, which are defined using a class and make it easier to keep track of the application state provided component. This component example gives an idea how you add onClick event in JSX.

# Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js
- NPM

# Quick Start

npx create-react-app Voting-System
cd Voting-System

### Start the React App

Excute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

### Get Started Immediately

You don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you’re good to go.

The application will start automatically in your browser on http://localhost:3000
